# Java_lab_1
This Java program validates an 8- or 9-digit credit card number based on a modified Luhn algorithm. It removes the last digit, reverses the remaining digits, and doubles every other digit (summing digits if necessary). After calculating a checksum, it compares the result with the original last digit to determine validity
