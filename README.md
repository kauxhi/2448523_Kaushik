# Java_lab_1
This Java program validates an 8- or 9-digit credit card number based on a modified Luhn algorithm. It removes the last digit, reverses the remaining digits, and doubles every other digit (summing digits if necessary). After calculating a checksum, the result is compared with the original last digit to determine the validity.
# 1-!
This Java program simulates a letter-based battle game in which left-side and right-side letters have different strengths. It can determine a winner by comparing a mixed word or two separate words, one for each side. The game supports default and customizable letter strengths for flexibility.
#Java_Lab_2
This Java program analyzes an integer array to find the top K numbers with the highest frequencies. It uses a HashMap to count occurrences, then sorts entries by frequency and number value (both in descending order). The top K frequent numbers are then printed, supporting flexible test cases.
# 2-!
This Java program calculates the maximum profit from at most two stock transactions on a given set of prices. It uses two arrays to track the best profit for a first and second transaction at each price point. By combining these, it finds the maximum possible profit achievable across two transactions.
